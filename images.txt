Images
Basic opt images
Basic optimizing images includes:
-canvas reducing (delete white/transparent/black borders)
-reducing color depth
-delete comments and stuff from EXIF
-convert to appropriate format

Compress images
-JPEG-targeted options: jpegtran or jpegoptim (av only for Linux, execute with parameter --strip-all)
-PNG-targeted: OptiPNG or PNGOUT.

PNG is much better than GIF, though in older (mobile) browser PNG support is limited
GIF could be used for very small, or very simple images (10x10px or 3-color) or for animated resources
Use JPG for photos
